# ES6 JavaScript
A collection of snippets focused on optimizing modern Javascript development productivity.
Write JavaScript quickly with over 150+ handy snippets. Fully ES6!
Less typing more coding!

# Note:
This is a fork of `atom-es6-javascript` by @hharnisc which in turn was a fork of `turbo-javascript` by @extrabacon.
~~The only reason for forking this wonderful project was the difference in styling between me and the original author.
Namely I prefer single quotes and no space between function and parentheses. That's it~~.

I feel like I have made enough changes to this project (and I will continue to add more and more) so to call it "just a fork", in my opinion isn't justified anymore.
